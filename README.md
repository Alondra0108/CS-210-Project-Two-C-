# CS-210-Project-Two-C-
This project, titled Airgead Banking, was developed as a C++ console application for CS 210. The purpose of the program is to help users visualize the long-term growth of an investment account by calculating interest accumulation over a user-defined number of years. The user inputs their initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and how many years they plan to invest. The application then generates two detailed yearly reports: one that calculates compound interest with no additional monthly deposits, and another that includes regular monthly contributions. These reports show the end-of-year balance and total interest earned for each year of the investment period.

The logic and structure of the program are implemented using an object-oriented approach. A class named InvestmentCalculator is used to store the userâ€™s input and perform the necessary financial calculations. The class includes functions for setting user data, formatting and printing annual summaries, and performing both versions of the compound interest calculation. These calculations are based on monthly compounding, and the results are displayed with clear formatting for easy reading. All the input is validated to ensure that only positive numbers are accepted, which prevents errors during calculation. The program also includes user interaction to repeat the process if the user wants to try different input values.

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable experience working with classes, functions, and user-defined types in C++. I learned how to build a modular application that separates logic across multiple files, which improves readability and maintainability. I also became more comfortable using cin and cout with validation, formatted output using iomanip, and writing functions that perform iterative calculations based on real-world financial models. This project not only taught me how to write more organized C++ code, but also helped me understand how to model real-life scenarios using programming techniques that can be applied to future personal or professional development projects.
